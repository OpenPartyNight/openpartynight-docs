## IR Keyboard/Mouse Remote

This solution provides a physical device for controlling the system.

## Mobile App

There are apps out there for using a mobile phone as a remote mouse/keyboard over Bluetooth. 

Things to consider:
- Which apps?
- Ease of bluetooth connection/setup (some way of being able to do automagically so Pis can be shipped without need for any peripherals besides mics?)
