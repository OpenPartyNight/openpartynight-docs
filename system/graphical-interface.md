# Overview

There are a few options to adding pretty, accessible interfaces.

# General Thoughts/Notes

- Contribute the OpenPartyNight versions of the compiled software to the add-on libraries for supported/tested interfaces, this would allow the name to spread out as Stepmania & Ultrastar (attributed to _OpenPartyNight_) become available in the game libraries (obvs with correct contribution & links to contributors/original software repos).

# Applications/Interfaces

## [Kodi](https://kodi.tv)

Used to be the XBMC project, definitely going to have a lot of support behind it. Basically full media center so it'd allow the console to be even further expandible.

Pros:
- Full media center (including [game library](https://kodi.wiki/view/Games) support
- Control API (so web browsers, remote controls, etc can all be configured to work with it)
    - Additionally, built-in support for many remote controls
- Application, not OS, so can be [installed on current distribution](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_Kodi_on_Raspberry_Pi#Raspberry_Pi_OS)

Cons:
- Game library support is currently very primative (and seems focussed on emulation)

Add-ons:
- [Sports TV](https://zone3tech.com/how-to-install-sporthd-kodi-addon-watch-live-sports-game/)
- [Retro Game Streamed from Internet Archive](https://www.maketecheasier.com/turn-kodi-gane-arcade-center/)


Initially concerned that the game support was too primitive but that seems like for integrated support for emulators. It seems like it'd be fairly straightforward to add a third-party game.

## [LibreELEC](https://libreelec.tv)

A fork of Kodi, focussed on being stable and providing enough OS stuff for Kodi.

Pros:
- Same as Kodi
- [Custom boot splash screen](https://libreelec.wiki/how-to/change-bootscreen)

Cons:
- Poorly documented
- Requires full OS install

## [OSMC](https://osmc.tv)

Looks in a similar vein to the above, again it seems like third-party apps can just be added to these sorts of things so perhaps it'd be quite easy to hack games in?
