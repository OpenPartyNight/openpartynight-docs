## Creating a Course

You can create "courses" consisting of your favourite songs!

To create a course, add a new file to `/opt/openpartynight/content/dance/Courses/` (with a `.crs` extension, e.g. `stuts-ultimate.crs`) with the following structure:

```
#COURSE:STUTS Ultimate;
#DESCRIPTION:All my favourite tracks in one place!;
#SCRIPTER:STUTS;
#METER:Beginner:5;

#SONG:Cooler Than Me:Medium;

```

Where:
- SCRIPTER = Your name/handle
- 

Personal Note: Started organising faves. Have been through most played, recently played and the Easy 3 folder.
